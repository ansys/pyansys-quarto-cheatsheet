# General section

Description of the first section goes here.

```{python}
import os
```

# Section with code output

Description of the second section goes here.

```{python}
print("Hello, world!")
```

# Section with code evaluation but no results included

This section is evaluated but execution results are not included in the output.
```{python}
#| output: false
print("Hello, world!")
```

# Section with code evaluation but no results included

This section is evaluated but execution results are not included in the output.

```{python}
#| output: false
print(os.getcwd())
```

# Section with code evaluation and results included

This section is evaluated and execution results are included in the output.

```{python}
print(os.getcwd())
```

# Section without code evaluation
```{python}
#| eval: false
print(os.getcwd())
```

If there is no evaluation, the code cell is not executed.
Thus, no execution results are included in the output.

# Section without code echo

This section is not evaluated, and the code cell is not shown in
the rendered document. However, the output is included in the
rendered document.

```{python}
#| echo: false
print("Hello, world!")
```

# Section without code echo and output
This section is not evaluated, and the code cell is not shown in
the rendered document. The output is also not included in the
rendered document.

```{python}
#| echo: false
#| output: false
print("Hello, world!")
```

## Mathematical operators and expressions

Mathematical expressions with operators:

- Comparison operators: $a \geq b$, $a \leq b$, $a > b$, $a < b$, $a = b$, $a \neq b$
- Arithmetic operations: $a + b$, $a - b$, $a \times b$, $a \div b$, $a^2$, $\sqrt{a}$
- Logical operators: $a \land b$, $a \lor b$, $\neg a$
- Set operations: $A \cup B$, $A \cap B$, $A \subseteq B$, $x \in A$

Complex expressions:
$$\int_{0}^{\infty} e^{-x^2} dx = \frac{\sqrt{\pi}}{2}$$

$$\sum_{i=1}^{n} i = \frac{n(n+1)}{2}$$

Algorithm pseudocode with math symbols:
```
for i = 1 to n:
    if x[i] ≥ threshold:
        result[i] ← x[i] × weight
    else:
        result[i] ← 0
```
